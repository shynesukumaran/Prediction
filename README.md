Prediction of Photovoltaic Output Power

The main aim of the project is to design a Machine Learning model to predict the output power of a Photovoltaic(PV) system.

A dataset containing the historical values of PV along with some weather parameters are available for the project.

An ANN is trained with the historical weather parameters and PV output power values.
An API key is registered for receiving future weather forecast data from a weather website. The trained ANN model will then predict the future PV output power using the weather forecast data.
